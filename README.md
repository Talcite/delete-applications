# Wikidot applications deletion userscript

[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) userscript for [Wikidot](https://www.wikidot.com/) users.

Adds two buttons to the messages inbox:

* **Delete applications on page:** Deletes all selected applications, or if no messages are selected, deletes all applications on the current page.
* **Delete all applications:** Deletes all applications in the user's inbox.

Before deletion is committed, a confirmation dialogue will be raised.

Especially useful for Wikidot administrators of popular sites, whose inboxes will quickly become full of applications, drowning out actual messages from other users. Use at own risk.
